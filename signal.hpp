    /*! This is the major class of all signal processing. Everything in octopus is a signal
        derivative. When constructing a signal, it asks for a Clock (see Clock.hpp for more
        information), which it will use for time keeping.

        Requesting samples from a signal can be done by calling the signal. This will return
        the same value until the clock has been moved forward with tick(). Therefore, walking
        through a signal corresponds to repeatedly requesting a sample and moving the clock further.
     
        @code{cpp}
        cout << sine() << endl;
        clock.tick();
        cout << sine() << endl;
        @endcode
     
        Besides accessing individual signal elements using call-syntax, one can manipulate signals
        as monolithic entities, reminiscent of mathematical signal theory.
