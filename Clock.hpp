     Invariable clocks are the most simple clocks available. You set their rate once, and
     signals with an invariable clock attached can then request the rate whenever they need it.
     A good example of a domain with an invariable clock would be audio. Although audio samples
     are often not actuallt generated every 1/44100 second (they are generated in 'bursts' by the
     audio callback), audio signals should operate as if the rate between every sample remains constant.
     That is how they will be *played back* after all. */

    /*! Clocks are used for keeping time with signals. Each signal compares its internal state

     Variable clocks automatically change their rate every time tick() is called, depending
     on the elapsed time since the previous tick. A good example of a domain with a variable
     clock would be video. The FPS (rate) in video applications changes every frame (some ticks
     take longer than others). Signals attached to variable clocks can request the rate or
     delta every frame anew and make sure they update themselves according to how much time the
     last tick took. */
